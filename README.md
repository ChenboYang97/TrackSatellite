# TrackSatellite
A website used to track satellites, built with React JS for the frontend and utilized [N2YO](https://www.n2yo.com/) for satellite data.  
  
This project only shows the trajectory of the Starlink satellites, but you can change the satellite category to fetch different satellites' locations from N2YO.

### Technologies used
